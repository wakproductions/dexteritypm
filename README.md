## Dexterity Project Manager
#### An Agile Project Management Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wakproductions/dexteritypm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wakproductions/dexteritypm) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wakproductions/dexteritypm/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wakproductions/dexteritypm)

This is a Rails application for collaborating on a software development project using Agile methodologies. The idea
for this system was spawned out of doing consulting work for bootstrap stage startups but not having a good tool for
communicating ideas and progress on technical work to my clients. There are numerous commercial programs out there
for Agile development, but I could not find one that is intuitive for non-technical end-users and for a price that
can't be beat (free!).

Dexterity PM is currently an open source project. For an rundown on the basic concepts of how this tool works, please
see the file [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md).

Feel free to log a Github issue ticket or make pull requests for any new features you would like to add.

### Project Status

This is not quite ready yet as a minimum viable product, but I am putting the source on Github for collaboration
and discussion. The [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) will be updated when the first official release is ready.


#### Test Notes

The Cucumber test structure is in place for integration testing but the steps have not yet been written. Right now
I'm most focused on unit testing using RSpec.
